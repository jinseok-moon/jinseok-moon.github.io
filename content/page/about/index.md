Hi, I’m Jinseok Moon.

I write about GPU programming and performance engineering—mostly CUDA, kernels, and how things work under the hood.

## What I’m focusing on

- CUDA kernel optimization (memory, tiling, occupancy)
- Linear algebra / GEMM fundamentals
- Practical performance debugging and benchmarking
